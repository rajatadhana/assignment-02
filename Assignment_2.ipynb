        "**Data structures** are specialized formats used to organize, store, and manage data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They define the relationship between data and the operations that can be performed on that data.\n",

        "- In Python, **lists and tuples** are both used to store collections of items, but they differ mainly in **mutability, performance, and usage**. A **list** is a **mutable** data type, which means its contents can be changed after it is created. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list using various built-in methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and `pop()`. Lists are defined using **square brackets**, for example: `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a **tuple** is an **immutable** data type, meaning once it is created, its contents cannot be changed. Tuples do not support item assignment or modification, and they have fewer built-in methods compared to lists. They are defined using **parentheses**, like `(1, 2, 3)`. Because tuples are immutable, they are generally **faster and more memory-efficient** than lists. This makes them suitable for situations where data should remain constant and protected from accidental changes.\n",
        "\n",

Each item in a dictionary has a **unique key** and a corresponding **value**, written in the form `{key: value}`. This structure allows for **efficient data retrieval** based on the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔹 Internal Working:\n",
        "\n",
        "Under the hood, dictionaries in Python use a **hash table** to store data. When a key-value pair is added:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The **key** is passed through a **hash function** to generate a unique hash code.\n",
        "* This hash code determines the **index (or location)** in the internal table where the value will be stored.\n",
        "* If two keys produce the same hash (called a **collision**), Python handles it through **collision resolution techniques**, ensuring data is still stored correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔹 Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Keys must be immutable** (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples), so they can be hashed.\n",
        "* **Values can be of any data type**, and multiple keys can map to the same value.\n",
        "* Access to values is **fast** because the dictionary uses hashing, which provides **constant-time complexity (O(1))** on average for lookup, insertion, and deletion.\n",
